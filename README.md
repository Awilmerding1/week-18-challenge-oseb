# Week 18 Challenge


## React Todo App


### Project Instructions

In this challenge we will create an application that incorporates data from an external API. The API we will be using is: http://api.open-notify.org/astros.

This application will have four components:
- App
- People
- Crafts
- NavBar

To complete this challenge you will practice working with the following concepts:
- Lifecycle Methods
- Async React
- Class vs. Functional Components
- Client-Side Routing


The skeleton of each component has been set up for you but you will need to implement the functionality outlined below.  

## App Component

The App component will be responsible for requesting the data from the API. Which lifecycle method would make sense to use for this request? The App component will also need to store the fetched data.

You should also set up your routes inside the App component. You should have two routes: one for your People component and one for your Crafts component.

The only component that your App component should render directly is the NavBar component


## NavBar Component

## People Component



## Crafts Component




## Getting Started

To start install the necessary packages, run `npm install` and then run `npm start` to start the application.
